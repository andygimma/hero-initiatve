  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>“We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say "It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not my problem." Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes.” – Mr. Fred Rogers</p>

  <p>For 35 years, Black Veterans for Social Justice has been serving Veterans, their families and the NYC community. In the spirit of furthering that mission, with our resources along with reaching out to community partners and elected officials, on November 4th 2014 we introduce the H.E.R.O (Human Educational Resource Outlet) Initiative. </p>
